  I am a Junior High School student (soon graduating!). I specialize in Graphic Design and programming with Lua & HTML.

  ## Work Exp.

  I have worked with one of the biggest banks in Indonesia, bank Mandiri, and contributed to small projects in competing game companies on ROBLOX. I've spearheaded a team of aspiring designers to help with a big school event that has invited big artists such as Reality Club.
